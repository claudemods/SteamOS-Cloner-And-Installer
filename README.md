# SteamOS-Cloner-And-Installer
C++ Script To Clone And Install SteamOS
This Is A Ongoing Project Similar To My Chrome Os Cloner

ive worked it out and and ive updated my code i will do some tests soon using my new command 

directly for fat16 boot partitions since that was my only issue from last tests

in the mean time you can test yourself if you want until i do just download the provided file steamoscloner

just be sure to resize your home partation to around 5gb since i have a set 20gb size for .img at the moment and it doesnt go by size of partitions


current tui and build
